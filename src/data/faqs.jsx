        question: "What are digital options?",
        answer: <p>Option is a derivative financial instrument based on any underlying asset, such as a stock, a currency pair, oil, etc. <br /><br /> Digital option - a non-standard option that is used to make a profit on price movements of such assets for a certain period of time. <br /><br /> A digital option, depending on the terms agreed upon by the parties to the transaction, at a time determined by the parties, brings a fixed income (the difference between the trade income and the price of the asset) or loss (in the amount of the value of the asset). <br /><br /> Since the digital option is purchased in advance at a fixed price, the size of the profit, as well as the size of the potential loss, are known even before the trade. <br /><br /> Another feature of these deals is the time limit. Any option has its own term (expiration time or conclusion time). <br /> <br /> Regardless of the degree of change in the price of the underlying asset (how much it has become higher or lower), in case of winning an option, a fixed payment is always made. Therefore, your risks are limited only by the amount for which the option is acquired.</p>

        question: "What are the varieties of digital options?",
        answer: <div>
            <div>Making an option trade, you must choose the underlying asset that will underlie the
                option. Your forecast will be carried out on this asset.</div>
            <div>Simply, buying a digital contract, you are actually betting on the price movement of
                such an underlying asset.</div>
            <div>An underlying asset is an “item” whose price is taken into account when concluding a
                trade.As the underlying asset of digital options, the most sought-after products on the
                markets usually act. There are four types of them:</div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>securities (shares of world companies)</span></li>
                    <li><span>currency pairs (EUR / USD, GBP / USD, etc.)</span></li>
                    <li><span>raw materials and precious metals (oil, gold, etc.)</span></li>
                    <li><span>indices (S&amp;P 500, Dow, dollar index, etc.)</span></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>There is no such thing as a universal underlying asset. When choosing it, you can only
                use your own knowledge, intuition, and various kinds of analytical information, as well
                as market analysis for a particular financial instrument.</div>
        </div>
    },
    {
        question: "What is the gist of digital options trading?",
        answer: <div>
            <div>The fact is that a digital option is the simplest type of derivative financial
                instrument. In order to make money in the digital options market, you do not need to
                predict the value of the market price of an asset that it can reach.</div>
            <div>The principle of the trading process is reduced only to the solution of one single task
                - the price of an asset will increase or decrease by the time the contract is executed.
            </div>
            <div>The aspect of such options is that it does not matter to you at all, that the price of
                the underlying asset will go one hundred points or only one, from the moment the trade
                is concluded to its close. It is important for you to determine only the direction of
                movement of this price.</div>
            <div>If your prognosis is correct, in any case you get a fixed income.</div>
        </div>

    {
        question: "How to learn quickly how to make money in the digital options market?",
        answer: <div>
            <div>To get a profit in the digital options market, you only need to correctly predict which
                way the price of the asset you have chosen will go (up or down). Therefore, for a stable
                income you need:</div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>develop your own trading strategies, in which the number of correctly
                        predicted trades will be maximum, and follow them</span></li>
                    <li><span>diversify your risks</span></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>In developing strategies, as well as in searching for diversification options, market
                monitoring, studying analytical and statistical information that can be obtained from
                various sources (Internet resources, expert opinions, analysts in this field, etc.) will
                help you, one of which is the Company website.</div>

    {
        question: "At what expense does the Company pay profit to the Client in case of successful trade?",
        answer: <div>
            <div>Company earns with customers. Therefore, it is interested in the share of profitable
                transactions significantly prevailing over the share of unprofitable ones, due to the
                fact that the Company has a percentage of payments for a successful trading strategy
                chosen by the Client.</div>
            <div>In addition, trades conducted by the Client together constitute the trading volume of
                the Company, which is transferred to a broker or exchange, which in turn are included in
                the pool of liquidity providers, which together leads to an increase in the liquidity of
                the market itself.</div>

    {
        question: "What is the expiration period of a trade?",
        answer: <div>
            <div>The expiration period is the time after which the trade will be considered completed
                (closed) and the result is automatically summed up.</div>
            <div>When concluding a trade with digital options, you independently determine the time of
                execution of the transaction (1 minute, 2 hours, month, etc.).</div>

    {
        question: "What is a trading platform and why is it needed?",
        answer: <div>
            <div>Trading platform - a software complex that allows the Client to conduct trades
                (operations) using different financial instruments. It has also accesses to various
                information such as the value of quotations, real-time market positions, actions of the
                Company, etc.</div>
        </div>
    },
    {
        question: "What are the possible results of the placed trades?",
        answer: <div>
            <div>There are three possible outcomes in the digital options market:</div>
            <div>(1) in the event that your prognosis of determining the direction of the price movement
                of the underlying asset is correct, you receive income.</div>
            <div>(2) if by the time the option was concluded your forecast turned out to be erroneous,
                you incur a loss limited by the size of the asset value (i.e., in fact, you can only
                lose your investment).</div>
            <div>(3) if the outcome of the trade is zero (the price of the underlying asset has not
                changed, the option is concluded at the price at which it was purchased), you return
                your investment.Thus, the level of your risk is always limited only by the size of the
                asset value.</div>
        </div>

        question: "Is the download of the program to a computer or smartphone required?",
        answer: <div>
            <div>No, it&rsquo;s not required. You just need to register on the Company&rsquo;s website in the
                presented form and open a individual account.</div>

        question: "In what currency is the Client's account opened? Can I change the currency of the Client's account?",
        answer: <div>
            <div>By default, a trading account is opened in US dollars.

                But for your convenience, the currency can be switched at any time in your profile.

            <div>
                The advantage of the Company&rsquo;s trading platform is that you don&rsquo;t have to deposit large
                amounts to your account. You can start trading by investing a small amount of money. The

        question: 'What determines profit size?',
        answer: <div>
            <div>There are several factors that affect the size of your profit:</div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>the liquidity of the asset you have chosen in the market (the more the
                        asset is in demand in the market, the more profit you will receive)</span>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>the time of the trade (the liquidity of an asset in the morning and the
                        liquidity of an asset in the afternoon can vary significantly)</span></li>
                    <li><span>tariffs of a brokerage company</span></li>

                        asset, etc.)</span></li>

        question: 'How can I calculate the profit for a trade?',
        answer: <div>
            <div>You do not have to calculate the profit yourself.</div>
            <div>A feature of digital options is a fixed amount of profit per transaction, which is
                calculated as a percentage of the value of the option and does not depend on the degree
                of change in this value. Suppose if the price changes in the direction predicted by you
                by only 1 position, you will earn 90% of the value of the option. You will earn the same
                amount if the price changes to 100 positions in the same direction.</div>
            <div>To determine the amount of profit, you must perform the following steps:</div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>choose the asset that will underlie your option</span></li>
                    <li><span>indicate the price for which you would have purchased the option</span>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>determine the time of the trade, after these actions, the platform will
                        automatically display the exact percentage of your profit, in case of a
                        correct prognosis</span></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>The profit from the trade can be up to 98% of the amount of the investment.</div>
            <div>The yield of a digital option is fixed immediately upon its acquisition, therefore you
                do not need to wait for unpleasant surprises in the form of a reduced percentage at the
                end of the trade.</div>
            <div>As soon as the trade is closed, your balance will automatically be replenished by the
                amount of this profit.</div>

        question: 'How to withdraw money from the account?',
        answer: <div>
            <div>The procedure for withdrawing capital is extremely simple and is carried out through
                your individual account.</div>
            <div>The method that you have chosen to deposit the account is also a method of withdrawing
                funds (see the question &ldquo;How can I deposit?&rdquo;).</div>
            <div>For example, if you made a deposit to your account via the Visa payment system, you
                will also withdraw money via the Visa payment system.</div>
            <div>When it comes to the withdrawal of a sufficiently large amount, the Company may request
                verification (verification is requested at the Company&rsquo;s sole discretion), which is why
                it is very important to register an account individually for yourself in order to

                operations.</div>
            <div>However, it is worth considering that payment systems can charge their fee and use the

            <div>To work with digital options you need to open an individual account. To conclude real
                trades, you will certainly need to make a deposit in the amount of options purchased.
            </div>
            <div>You can start trading without cash, only using the company&rsquo;s training account (demo
                account). Such an account is free of charge and created to demonstrate the functioning
                of the trading platform. With the help of such an account, you can practice acquiring
                digital options, understand the basic principles of trading, test various methods and
                strategies, or evaluate the level of your intuition.</div>

                &ldquo;Deposit&rdquo; button in the account profile.</div>
            <div>(2) After it is necessary to choose a method of depositing the account (the Company
                offers a lot of convenient methods that are available to the Client and are displayed in
                his individual account).</div>
            <div>(3) Next, indicate the currency in which the account will be deposited, and accordingly
                the currency of the account itself.</div>
            <div>(4) Enter the amount of the deposit.</div>
            <div>(5) Fill out the form by entering the requested payment details.</div>

            <div>On average, the withdrawal procedure takes from one to five days from the date of
                receipt of the corresponding request of the Client and depends only on the volume of

            <div>The minimum withdrawal amount starts from 10 USD for most payment systems.<br />For
                cryptocurrencies this amount starts from 50 USD (and may be higher for certain

        question: 'Do I need to provide any documents to make a withdrawal?',

            <div>Usually, additional documents to withdraw funds are not needed . But the Company at its
                discretion may ask you to confirm your personal data by requesting certain documents.
                Usually this is done in order to prevent activities related to illegal trade, financial
                fraud, as well as the use of funds obtained illegally.</div>
            <div>The list of such documents is minimum, and the operation to provide them will not take

        question: 'What is account verification?',
        answer: <div>
            <div>Verification in digital options is a confirmation by the Client of his personal data by
                providing the Company with additional documents. Verification conditions for the Client
                are as simple as possible, and the list of documents is minimum. For example, a Company
                may ask:</div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>provide a color scan copy of the first spread of the Client&rsquo;s passport
                        (passport page with photo)</span></li>
                    <li><span>identify with the help of a &ldquo;selfie&rdquo; (photograph of himself)</span></li>
                    <li><span>confirm the address of registration (residence) of the Client, etc</span>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>The Company may request any documents if it is not possible to fully identify the
                Client and the data entered by him.</div>
            <div>After the electronic copies of documents have been submitted to the Company, the Client
                will have to wait some time to verify the data provided.</div>
        </div>

            <div>You will receive a notification by e-mail and / or SMS notification about the
